## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- pip or poetry for package management
- Git

### Local Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alphaonelabs/alphaonelabs-education-website.git
   cd alphaonelabs-education-website
   ```

2. Set up virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies (Poetry is the single source of truth):

   ```bash
   # Ensure Poetry installed (once)
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install poetry==1.8.3

   # Install project deps into local venv (recommended)
   poetry install

   # Activate virtualenv (Poetry 1.8 auto-detects)
   poetry shell  # or just use: poetry run <command>
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:

   ```bash
   cp .env.sample .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

5. Run migrations:

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. Create a superuser:

   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

7. Create test data:

   ```bash
   python manage.py create_test_data
   ```

8. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

9. Visit [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.

### Docker Setup

1. Build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t education-website .
   ```

2. Run the Docker container:

   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 8000:8000 education-website
   ```

3. Visit [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.

### Admin Credentials:

- **Email:** `admin@example.com`
- **Password:** `adminpassword`

## Environment Variables Configuration

Copy `.env.sample` to `.env` and configure the variables.

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 guidelines for Python code.
- Use **Black** for code formatting.
- Use **isort** for import sorting.
- Follow Django's coding style guide.
- Use **ESLint** for JavaScript code.

### Git Workflow

1. Create a new branch for each feature/bugfix.
2. Follow **conventional commits** for commit messages.
3. Submit **pull requests** for review.
4. Ensure all **tests pass** before merging.

### Testing

- Write unit tests for new features.
- Run tests before committing:

  ```bash
  python manage.py test
  ```

### Pre-commit Hooks (Important)

We use pre-commit to enforce formatting (black, isort), linting (flake8, djlint), etc.

```bash
poetry run pre-commit install
poetry run pre-commit run --hook-stage commit
poetry run pre-commit run --all-files
```

See [PRE-COMMIT-README.md](PRE-COMMIT-README.md) for detailed information about our pre-commit workflow and configuration.

### Documentation

- Document all new features and API endpoints
- Update README.md when adding major features
- Use docstrings for Python functions and classes
- Comment complex logic
