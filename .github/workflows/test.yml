            Your pull request has linting issues that need to be fixed before it can be merged.

            ### ⏰ Save Time By Running Checks Locally!

            **Important:** We run 8 different linting checks in CI, and they fail independently. Not running these checks locally before pushing can waste significant time as you may need multiple CI cycles to fix all issues.

            ### How to fix locally:

            1. **Install pre-commit tools:**
               \`\`\`bash
               pip install pre-commit
               \`\`\`

            2. **Set up the hooks:**
               \`\`\`bash
               pre-commit install
               \`\`\`

            3. **Run checks across all files:**
               \`\`\`bash
               pre-commit run --all-files
               \`\`\`

            4. **Fix the identified issues** in your code

            5. **Commit your changes** and push to update this PR

            ### Check Types That May Be Failing:
            - ✅ Python style issues (flake8)
            - ✅ HTML template formatting (djlint)
            - ✅ Code formatting inconsistencies (black)
            - ✅ Import ordering problems (isort)
            - ✅ Trailing whitespace and file endings
            - ✅ YAML/JSON/TOML syntax
            - ✅ Merge conflicts
            - ✅ Django configuration

            **Pro Tip:** After setting up pre-commit with \`pre-commit install\`, it will automatically run on every commit you make, catching issues before they reach CI!
